# Mazepa Bot

## About
 
As you know the russian president Vladimir Putler started a war on Ukraine. Many of us who are working in IT are 
willing to fight back using our professional skills. Thus, we fight in a less dangerous but non-the-less important digital front.
To help with that I've created Mazepa Bot. It can run ddos attacks from your machine using Telegram messages. So you can be
pizdity a russian occupant and running a DDOS on FSB at the same time.


## Installation
1. Install Docker: https://www.docker.com/
2. Install any VPN of your choice (protonVPN, openVPN, nordVPN) and select a russian region
3. Create a perosnal bot:
   1. Create a Bot using @BotFather and get an API token(google a guide)
   2. `cp .env.example .env`
   3. write your token into .env
4. In a terminal run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python main.py`
6. Send a "/start" message to your bot.
7. (Optional) Send the text from `bot_commands.txt` to @BotFather when setting the commands for hints.


## Improvements
If you can improve this bot in any way please do! Just create a PR and I will review it.

## Disclaimer
This is not a political project. There is nothing "political" about defending yourself. There is nothing "political" about 
willing to live and to raise your children. Politics is about power. This is about our freedom.
